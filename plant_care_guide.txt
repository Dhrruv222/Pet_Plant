PLANT CARE GUIDE FOR DIGITAL PETS

===== WATERING REQUIREMENTS =====

Soil Moisture Levels:
- Optimal: 50-70% soil moisture
- Warning: Below 20% requires immediate watering
- Critical: Below 10% is drought stress
- Overwatering: Above 80% can cause root rot

When to water:
- Water when soil feels dry to touch
- Most plants need watering every 2-3 days
- Reduce watering in winter months
- Water thoroughly until it drains from bottom

Signs of underwatering:
- Dry, crispy leaves
- Wilting appearance
- Stunted growth
- Yellowing of older leaves

Signs of overwatering:
- Yellow leaves
- Root rot smell
- Soggy soil
- Fungus gnats

===== TEMPERATURE & HUMIDITY =====

Optimal Temperature Range: 18-25°C
- Most indoor plants thrive in this range
- Below 10°C: dormant, may die
- Above 30°C: heat stress, wilting
- Sudden temperature changes cause shock

Optimal Humidity: 40-60%
- Low humidity (<30%): Brown leaf tips, slow growth
- High humidity (>80%): Fungal diseases, mold
- Increase humidity by misting or grouping plants

===== LIGHT REQUIREMENTS =====

Light needs vary by plant type:
- Low light plants: Indirect light, 2-4 hours
- Medium light plants: Bright indirect light, 4-6 hours
- High light plants: Direct sunlight, 6+ hours

Signs of insufficient light:
- Pale, small leaves
- Leggy growth (sparse, stretched stems)
- Slow growth
- Leaves facing toward light source

===== NUTRITION & SOIL =====

Fertilizing Schedule:
- Growing season (Spring/Summer): Every 2-4 weeks
- Dormant season (Fall/Winter): Once monthly or skip
- Over-fertilizing causes salt buildup, leaf burn

Soil Requirements:
- Well-draining potting mix
- pH 6.0-7.0 for most plants
- Mix should retain moisture but not be soggy
- Refresh soil annually

===== COMMON PROBLEMS & SOLUTIONS =====

Yellowing Leaves:
- Check watering (too much or too little)
- Ensure adequate light
- Check for nutrient deficiency
- Could indicate pest infestation

Brown Leaf Tips:
- Usually low humidity
- Increase misting or place on humidity tray
- Also check for underwatering

Wilting Despite Moist Soil:
- Possible root rot from overwatering
- Improve drainage
- Repot if necessary
- Check for disease

Pest Control:
- Inspect new plants before bringing home
- Isolate infested plants
- Use neem oil or insecticidal soap
- Remove pests manually if possible

===== SEASONAL CARE =====

Spring:
- Increase watering as growth accelerates
- Begin regular fertilizing
- Repot if root-bound
- Increase light exposure gradually

Summer:
- Maintain consistent watering (soil dries faster)
- Watch for heat stress
- Increase humidity
- Continue regular fertilizing

Fall:
- Gradually reduce watering
- Reduce fertilizing frequency
- Prepare for dormancy
- Bring plants away from cold drafts

Winter:
- Minimal watering (soil stays moist longer)
- Reduce fertilizing (optional light feeding)
- Increase artificial light if needed
- Keep away from heating vents

===== EMERGENCY SITUATIONS =====

Gas/Air Pollutants (High MQ-2):
- Remove plant from source immediately
- Ensure ventilation in the room
- Clean leaves with soft, damp cloth
- Monitor for leaf damage
- Keep away from smoke, car exhaust, chemical sprays

Recovery from Stress:
- Isolate from other plants
- Provide stable conditions
- Don't fertilize stressed plants
- Increase humidity
- Be patient - recovery takes weeks

Saving a Dying Plant:
1. Assess the problem (water, light, pests, disease)
2. Remove dead leaves/stems
3. Improve soil conditions
4. Adjust watering/light
5. Quarantine if diseased
6. Give it time to recover
